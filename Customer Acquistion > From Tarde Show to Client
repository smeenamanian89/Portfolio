In today's data-saturated industries—be it healthcare, retail, or insurance—organizations are sitting on a goldmine of unstructured data. Yet, transforming that data into actionable insights is where the real challenge lies. At SquareML, we’ve built solutions specifically to address this gap. And sometimes, the best place to showcase that value is not in a Zoom call or slide deck—but live, on the trade show floor.

Setting the Stage: Why Trade Shows Still Matter

While many consider trade shows “old school,” they remain one of the most effective touchpoints to showcase innovation, build trust, and demonstrate product-market fit. At a recent industry event focused on digital transformation and AI in regulated industries, our team had the opportunity to connect with decision-makers seeking scalable data solutions.

The Real-Time Spark: Live Demo That Made an Impact

One conversation stood out. A representative from a mid-sized provider network shared a common frustration: their clinical and operational teams were spending countless hours summarizing EHRs and claims for reporting and compliance. They needed a solution that could automate and intelligently extract insights from both structured and unstructured data—without complex integrations or long onboarding cycles.

We immediately showed them a live demo of our Generative AI-powered summarization engine, built using Vertex AI and GPT-based models, which parses through clinical notes, lab results, prior authorizations, and free-text claims data to surface actionable patterns and risks.

What resonated most?

Speed: Results generated in seconds, not hours.
Relevance: Model outputs were domain-tuned for healthcare and clearly aligned with clinical and operational KPIs.
Simplicity: A no-code interface that enabled analysts and care coordinators to extract what they needed—no engineering help required.
From Demo to Deal: What Made the Difference

The follow-up cycle was swift. Within three weeks, the team conducted a pilot using a subset of their own data. Our platform reduced manual effort by over 70%, enhanced documentation accuracy, and directly supported value-based care reporting needs.

Key to closing the deal:

Clear demonstration of ROI through time saved and reduced reporting gaps
Ability to integrate with their existing data sources without heavy IT lift
Open dialogue about roadmap alignment, ensuring the product evolved with their needs
Lessons Learned: Trade Show Conversion Tips

Lead with a Real Use Case – Show, don’t just tell. Data transformation is best understood visually.
Customize On-the-Spot – Speak their language. Whether it's HCCs, POS receipts, or care gaps, tailor the story to their pain point.
Have Stakeholders On Hand – We had a PM, data scientist, and engineer on-site. It helped answer questions live and build trust.
Be Ready for Quick Follow-Up – A working pilot within a week helped sustain momentum.
Closing Thoughts

Trade shows may be crowded, noisy, and intense—but they also offer rare face-to-face moments where ideas meet urgency. For us, it was a chance to connect, empathize, and ultimately prove our value with a real customer problem.

Unstructured data isn’t going away. But with the right tools—and the right conversations—it becomes a powerful catalyst for smarter decisions.
